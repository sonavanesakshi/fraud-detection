Fraud Detection Project

This project is a Fraud Detection system developed in Python. It runs in a custom Anaconda environment named fraud, and the application is built using Streamlit to create an interactive web interface (deployed).

Project Structure app.py: Main file to run the Streamlit app. requirements.txt: List of required Python packages to install in the environment. models/: Directory containing trained models. data/: Directory containing datasets used for training and testing. scripts/: Folder containing additional scripts for data processing and model building. Getting Started Prerequisites Make sure you have Anaconda installed on your system. You can download it from here.

Setting up the Environment Open Anaconda Prompt. Navigate to the project directory using the following command: bash Copy code cd C:\Users\Fraud Detection Create and activate the environment for the project. If the environment already exists, simply activate it: bash Copy code conda activate fraud Installing Dependencies To ensure you have all the required packages, you can install the necessary dependencies by running:

bash Copy code pip install -r requirements.txt Required Packages The following packages are typically required for this project (add or modify according to your actual requirements):

streamlit: For creating the web application interface. pandas: For data manipulation and analysis. numpy: For numerical operations. scikit-learn: For machine learning models and preprocessing. matplotlib: For data visualization. seaborn: For statistical data visualization. joblib: For saving and loading models. pyod: For outlier detection. You can add more packages as needed for your specific implementation.

Running the App To start the Streamlit app, use the following command in the Anaconda prompt:

bash Copy code streamlit run app.py This will open the Streamlit application in your web browser.

Usage Once the app is running, you can interact with it through the browser interface. It allows you to input various parameters and receive real-time fraud detection predictions based on your input.

Features Real-Time Predictions: Get instant predictions on whether a transaction is fraudulent or legitimate. Data Visualization: Visualize trends and patterns in the data using graphs and charts. Model Training: Optionally train models on new datasets. Example Input

Troubleshooting If you encounter any issues with package installations, make sure your conda environment is properly activated. If the app does not open in the browser, check the Anaconda prompt for any error messages. Contributing Contributions are welcome! Please feel free to open issues or submit pull requests.
